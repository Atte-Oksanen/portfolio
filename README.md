# My web portfolio
This project was originally made with vanilla js,
but as the complexity grew, I decided to continue the project with React.

## About the project
This project is bootstrapped with React, but for the sake of practice I constrained myself from using npm-packages to build my site.  
That means that all modules and components except for gh-pages are custom made by me for this project.
