# My web portfolio

This project was originally made with only vanilla js, html, and css, (found [here](https://github.com/Atte-Oksanen/web_portfolio))  
but I decided to port the project to React to make it more maintainable.  

## About the project
This project is bootstrapped with React, but for the sake of practice I constrained myself from using npm-packages to build my site.  
That means that all modules and components are custom made for this project.
